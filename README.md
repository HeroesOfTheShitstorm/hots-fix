# hots-fix

The purpose of this repo is to discuss Heroes of the Storm bugs and issues.
Hoping that one day Blizzard will encounter this repo and will try to update us on the issues.

The long term objective is to get HOTS source code to allow community to solve the issues.

We are all doing this for the love of this game ❤️


Background
------
[On December 13, 2018, Blizzard announces](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/22833558/heroes-of-the-storm-news) that they 
would stop funding eSports for this title.

We definitely think that, with the right fixes and discussions, HOTS can be for sure one of the most enjoyable eSport games.
We have seen so many times, in the competitive scenes, incredible shining moves from great players.

Contribution
------
Feel free to open issues as soon as they are causing a real problem in the game.
The more we are, the more they'll listen to us 🚀🚀🚀

## N.B.
All the content has good and constructive humor behind it!
